          My name is Aaron Krauss. I’m a Full Stack developer based out of Edmond, Oklahoma (near Oklahoma City).
          I was born in Germany in 1990, grew up in a German culture for 6 years, and still speak moderately fluent German.
          I currently work at Staplegun Inc. as a web developer and designer, and engage in miscellaneous development on my own time.

      I have been coding since I was 14 in my first high school programming class, and I’ve become a major polyglot programmer since then.
      Starting with <span class='hi'>Visual Basic</span> (anyone remember that?), I then went on to learn <span class="hi">Java</span>, <span class="hi">C</span>,
      <span class="hi">C++</span>, <span class="hi">HTML</span>, <span class="hi">CSS</span>, <span class="hi">VB.NET</span>, <span class="hi">C#</span>,

      <span class="hi">Prolog</span>…. The list could go on and on.

    <p>I’ve gotten to work on some pretty cool things in my past, such as a Lego Mindstorm robotics project, a
      Term Frequency/Inverse Document Frequency search engine, interactive web forms for the FAA, and that was all just while in college.
      I’ve learned a ton more since then.</p>

    <p>My background is that of a back-end developer, specializing in object-oriented programming in both software and web development.
      I prefer to program in a Unix-based environment, utilizing the terminal heavily for everything.
      My main skills here are <span class="hi">Ruby/Rails</span>, <span class="hi">PHP</span>, <span class="hi">SQL</span>,
      <span class="hi">NoSQL</span>, <span class="hi">APIs</span>, and <span class="hi">Ember.js</span>.</p>

    <p>Recently, I’ve been doing a lot of front-end development, getting my hands dirty with a bunch of <span class="hi">HTML5</span>, <span class="hi">Sass</span>,
      <span class="hi">Javascript</span>, <span class="hi">Grunt.js</span>, and CMSs like <span class="hi">Wordpress</span>,
      <span class="hi">ModX</span>, and <span class="hi">Craft.</span> I have used <span class="hi">Foundation</span> heavily in the past,
      and a bit of <span class="hi">Bootstrap</span>, but now I choose to build my own responsive styles using just a tiny sass plugin to provide a grid.
      Check out my projects to see what I’ve been working on, or you can hire me if you have a cool project and need a remote developer!</p>
