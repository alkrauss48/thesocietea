= Don't risk your backups on anything less =

Your WordPress backups are worth the same as your entire investment in your website. The day may come when you get hacked, or your hosting company does, or they go bust - without good backups, you lose everything. Do you really want to entrust all your work to a backup plugin with only a few thousand downloads, or that has no professional backup or support? Believe us - writing a reliable backup plugin that works consistently across the huge range of WordPress deployments is hard.

= UpdraftPlus Premium =

UpdraftPlus Backup/Restore is not crippled in any way - it is fully functional for backing up and restoring your site. What we do have is various extra features (including site cloning), and guaranteed support, available <a href="https://updraftplus.com/">from our website, updraftplus.com</a>. See <a href="https://updraftplus.com/comparison-updraftplus-free-updraftplus-premium/">a comparison of the free/Premium versions, here</a>.

If you need WordPress multisite backup compatibility (you'll know if you do), <a href="https://updraftplus.com/shop/">then you need UpdraftPlus Premium</a>.

= UpdraftCentral - Remote control =

As well as controlling your backups from within WordPress, you can also control all your sites' backups from a single dashboard, with <a href="https://updraftcentral.com">UpdraftCentral</a>. UpdraftCentral can control both free and Premium versions of UpdraftPlus, and comes in two versions:

* Hosted dashboard: <a href="https://updraftplus.com/my-account/updraftcentral-remote-control/">a ready-to-go dashboard on updraftplus.com</a>, with 5 free licences for everyone (<a href="https://updraftcentral.com">read more here</a>).
* Host your own: Host the dashboard on your own WP install, with <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/updraftcentral/">the free self-install plugin</a>

= Professional / Enterprise support agreements available =

UpdraftPlus Backup/Restore is written by professional WordPress developers. If your site needs guaranteed support, then we are available. Just  <a href="https://updraftplus.com/shop/">go to our shop.</a>

= More premium plugins =

= Are you multi-lingual? Can you translate? =

Are you able to translate UpdraftPlus into another language? Are you ready to help speakers of your language? UpdraftPlus Backup/Restore itself is ready and waiting - the only work needed is the translating. The translation process is easy, and web-based - go here for instructions: <a href="https://updraftplus.com/translate/">https://updraftplus.com/translate/</a>. (Or if you're an expert WordPress translator already, then just pick out the .pot file from the wp-content/plugins/updraftplus/languages/ directory - if you scan for translatable strings manually, then you need to get these functions: _x(), __(), _e(), _ex(), log_e()).

Many thanks to the existing translators - listed at: https://updraftplus.com/translate/

= Other support =

We hang out in the WordPress support forum for this plugin - https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/updraftplus - however, to save time so that we can spend it on development, please read the plugin's FAQs - <a href="https://updraftplus.com/support/frequently-asked-questions/">https://updraftplus.com/support/frequently-asked-questions/</a> - before going there, and ensure that you have updated to the latest released version of UpdraftPlus backup/restore.

== Installation ==

<a href="https://updraftplus.com/download/">Full instructions for installing this plugin.</a>

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

<a href="https://updraftplus.com/support/frequently-asked-questions/"><strong>Please go here for the full FAQs - there are many more than below.</strong></a> Below are just a handful which particularly apply to the free wordpress.org version, or which bear repeating.

= Can UpdraftPlus do (something)? =

Check out <a href="https://updraftplus.com/updraftplus-full-feature-list/">our full list of features</a>, and our <a href="https://updraftplus.com/shop/">add-ons shop</a> and <a href="https://updraftplus.com/comparison-updraftplus-free-updraftplus-premium/">free/Premium comparison table</a>.

= I found a bug. What do I do? =

Note - this FAQ is for users of the free plugin. If you're a paying customer, then you should go here: https://updraftplus.com/support/ - please don't ask question in the WordPress.Org forum about purchases, as that's against their rules.

Next, please make sure you read this FAQ through - it may already have the answer you need. If it does, then please consider a donation (e.g. buy our "No Adverts" add-on - <a href="https://updraftplus.com/shop/">https://updraftplus.com/shop/</a>); it takes time to develop this plugin and FAQ.

If it does not, then contact us (<a href="http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/updraftplus">the forum is the best way</a>)! This is a complex backup plugin and the only way we can ensure it's robust is to get bug reports and fix the problems that crop up. Please make sure you are using the latest version of the plugin, and that you include the version in your bug report - if you are not using the latest, then the first thing you will be asked to do is upgrade.

Please include the backup log if you can find it (there are links to download logs on the UpdraftPlus settings page; or you may be emailed it; failing that, it is in the directory wp-content/updraft, so FTP in and look for it there). If you cannot find the log, then I may not be able to help so much, but you can try - include as much information as you can when reporting (PHP version, your blog's site, the error you saw and how you got to the page that caused it, any other relevant plugins you have installed, etcetera). http://pastebin.com is a good place to post the log.

If you know where to find your PHP error logs (often a file called error_log, possibly in your wp-admin directory (check via FTP)), then that's even better (don't send multi-megabytes; just send the few lines that appear when you run a backup, if any).

If you are a programmer and can debug and send a patch, then that's even better.

= Anything essential to know? =

After you have set up UpdraftPlus, you must check that your WordPress backups are taking place successfully. WordPress is a complex piece of software that runs in many situations. Don't wait until you need your backups before you find out that they never worked in the first place. Remember, there's no warranty and no guarantees - this is free software.

= My enormous website is hosted by a dirt-cheap provider who starve my account of resources, and UpdraftPlus runs out of time! Help! Please make UpdraftPlus deal with this situation so that I can save two dollars! =

UpdraftPlus supports resuming backup runs right from the beginning, so that it does not need to do everything in a single go; but this has limits. If your website is huge and your web hosting company gives your tiny resources on an over-loaded server, then go into the "Expert settings" and reduce the size at which zip files are split (versions 1.6.53 onwards). UpdraftPlus is known to successfully back up websites that run into the multiple-gigabytes on web servers that are not resource-starved.

= My site was hacked, and I have no backups! I thought UpdraftPlus was working! Can I kill you? =

No, there's no warranty or guarantee, etc. It's completely up to you to verify that UpdraftPlus is creating your backups correctly. If it doesn't then that's unfortunate, but this is a free plugin.

= I am not running the most recent version of UpdraftPlus. Should I upgrade? =

Yes; especially before you submit any support requests.

= Do you have any other free plugins? =

Thanks for asking; yes, we've got a few. Check out this profile page - https://profiles.wordpress.org/DavidAnderson/ .
