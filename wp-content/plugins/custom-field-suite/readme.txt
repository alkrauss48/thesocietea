Custom Field Suite (CFS) is a lightweight custom fields plugin

== Description ==

= Custom Field Suite (CFS) is a lightweight custom fields plugin =

* Visually create and manage custom fields
* Over a dozen field types: text, date, wysiwyg, relationship, file upload, user, loop, google maps, etc.
* Each field group has a "Placement Rules" area, where you define which edit screens to appear on
* Loop fields are repeatable containers for other fields. For example, place a `File Upload` field into a loop to create a gallery!
* Create your own field types using the `cfs_field_types` hook
* Includes client-side field validation
* This plugin is a free, lightweight alternative to Advanced Custom Fields.
