Custom Field Suite (CFS) allows you to attach custom fields to posts types.

== Description ==

= Custom Field Suite (CFS) allows you to attach custom fields to posts types. =

CFS lets you visually create an manage custom fields. You first create a Field Group, which contains one or more custom fields.
You're able to easily add custom fields through the admin UI. There's over 12 field types to choose from, include text, date,
wysiwyg, file upload, relationship, user, loop (repeatable fields), etc.

After you've set up your field group, you simply set where the fields appear using the Placement Rules box. You can attach custom fields to
entire post types, specific post items, pages using a specific template, etc.

CFS also supports the creation of custom field types by using the `cfs_field_types` filter.

This plugin is a free, lightweight alternative to Advanced Custom Fields.
